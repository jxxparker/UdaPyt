# Explore a Public Dataset
# Fortunately, we need not search endlessly for concrete examples of data sets – in this world, we are immersed in them. The inescapable presence of structured information surrounds us and informs all aspects of modern life – not just digital technology, but everything, from earth science to economics, machine learning to museums, language to politics.

# For this exercise, you'll find an existing public dataset and describe its structure, using the language of schemas, in a brief paragraph or two.
