You have access to a database of student_scores in the format of a dictionary. The keys in student_scores are the names of the students and the values are their exam scores.

Write a program that converts their scores to grades. By the end of your program, you should have a new dictionary called student_grades that should contain student names for keys and their grades for values. The final version of the student_grades dictionary will be checked.

DO NOT modify lines 1-7 to change the existing student_scores dictionary.

DO NOT write any print statements.
