On behalf of luis and myself, we wanted to show our love and gratitude to our brother, tae kim. We all have known each other almost two decades at this point and we have seen right about everything about his character.

Tae loves to joke.
Tae loves making fun of you.
Tae loves to put his loved in awkward situations for some laughter.
Tae loves chipotle and sulung tang.
Tae is the only human I seen drinking coffee at 11pm. 태완아 커피좀 주리자 몸에 나뻐
But most importantly, tae is the most caring human being I came across in my life.
As a friend, Tae never has bad intention and always root for your success. 
Tae will always never say no when you ask him for favor and will do always look for ways to get things done for you.
We appreciate the friendship we made in the last how many whatever years we have known each other.

We wish you and sooji the lovely marriage. 
We all love you guys and we root for your eternal happiness.
We could not have asked for better friend in any lifetime.
You have shown us what true love is today.
We appreciate you and thank you for everything.
Be legendary and be happy forever together.


태완아 질문 하나가 있어.
What do all these things have in common? 
drinking late at night, clubbing, and vegas.
이제 그런 날들은 끝났어.

태완와 수지야, 행복한 결혼생활 하길 바랄게. 
앞으로 힘든 날도 있겠지만, remember what brought you guys together, today.
태완아... you told me...
"me and sooji both have to rely on each other because one bridge might break"
둘다 변하지말고 항상 서로를 의지하고 아껴줘. 
오늘 이렇게 아름다운 날을 초대해 줘서 정말 고마위.
둘이 행복하고 근사하게 살길 항상 응원할게.
사랑해(depending on my mood i might not say, gf told me to say)
토스트!
