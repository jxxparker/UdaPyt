                        <h4>About me</h4>
                        <hr>
                        <p>Welcome (again)! My name is Jihun Park and if you reading this, that probably means you are somewhat interested in me. You are at the right place.</p>
						<h4>Career</h4>
						<p>First of all, I am a coding bootcamp graduate, however, I consider myself more of a self taught developer. From the moment I produced <strong>"Hello World"</strong> in the console, I knew I was hooked into the world of technology. I immediately became curious and excited for endless possibilities of what I can build potentially. Doing some research, I realized Python would be the language of my choice to write most of my codes in. This portfolio youa re seeing is mostly built with <strong>Python with Django Framework</strong>. Most of my projects you will see are most likely written with Python and Javascript.</p>
						<h4>Hobbies</h4>
						<p>One of the things I priortize in life is <strong>health</strong>. I take fitness very seriously and I believe everyone should put in some exercise especially in 2022. I also love watching and playing basketball. Growing up, I was a huge NBA fan and I consider myself <strong>analytical/statistc</strong> junkie in sports. Another one of my hobbies is playing <strong>Chess</strong>. There was a point in time where I seriously considered becoming a professional chess player.</p>

						<h4>Goals in Life</h4>
				
						<p>Just like most people, one of my goals is to reach financial freedom. One of my goals is to somehow make a difference in the world. I believe by always getting better at my craft, someday I can create a product that help people for the better.</p>
