# List Comprehensions

#a list comprehension is a concise way to create and populate a list in python in a declaritive way, rather than imperative, fashion. consider the following snippet to produce a list of the first 100 perfect squares.

# squares = []
# for x in range(10):
#     squares.append(x ** 2) #0,1,4, so on

# print(squares)

# y = [x ** 2 for x in range(10) if x % 2 == 0]
# print(y) #0,4,16,36,64
