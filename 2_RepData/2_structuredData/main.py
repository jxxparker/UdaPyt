#Basic Elements
# When discussing digital information, it's convenient to imagine (at least) three basic types of elements of data: booleans, numbers, and text.

# A boolean value represents either True or False, and encodes data with binary values. The answer to a Yes/No question, whether a light switch is current on, or whether you are logged into Netflix can all be represented as boolean values.

# A number value is a mathematical number â€“ integral or otherwise. The number of friends you have, the change in revenue of your company in this quarter, or the distance to the nearest gas station can all be represented as number values.

# A text value is a string of characters that represents textual data. A parent's name, the oeuvre of Arthur Conan Doyle, or a username on a website can all be represented as text values.
